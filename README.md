# FPGA_Traffic_Light_Controller

Our approach is to control the access to areas shared among multiple intersections and allocating effective time between various users. The implementation is based on a real location in San Jose California.

- Designed a highly precise state machine for smooth uninterrupted flow of traffic.
- Build a working prototype model using LED's and seven segment displays.
- Tool: Intel Quartus, Language: Verilog.
